# Project: Weather App
### ‚û°Ô∏è The Challenge: Creating an App That Fetches Data From an API and Displays It On a Webpage.
## üó∫ The guide
#### Step 1: Setting Up the Framework
1. Create a new HTML document.
2. Include links to your external JavaScript and CSS files within the <head> section of your HTML.

#### Step 2:  Building API Interaction Functions
1. Write JavaScript functions that interact with a weather API.
2. These functions should take a location as input and retrieve the corresponding weather data.
3. For now, simply use <code>console.log()</code> to print the retrieved information.

#### Step 3: Processing API Data
1. Write functions to process the JSON data received from the API.
2. Extract and format the specific data points needed for your weather app.
3. The output of these functions should be an object containing the processed data.

#### Step 4: User Input and Data Fetching
1. Create an HTML form with an input field for users to enter their location.
2. Implement functionality to trigger the weather data fetching process upon form submission.
3. Again, utilize <code>console.log()</code> to display the fetched data initially.

#### Step 5:: Displaying Weather Information
1. Update your HTML structure to display the processed weather data in a user-friendly format.
2. This might involve creating elements to show details like temperature, weather conditions, etc.

#### Step 6: Styling Your App
1. Add CSS styles to enhance the visual appeal of your weather app.
2. Customize the layout, typography, and overall presentation.

#### Step 7: Adding a Loading Indicator (Optional)
1. Implement a loading indicator that displays while the app fetches data from the API. This helps provide feedback to users about the ongoing process.
2. Utilize browser developer tools to simulate low-bandwidth scenarios and test the loading behavior.
